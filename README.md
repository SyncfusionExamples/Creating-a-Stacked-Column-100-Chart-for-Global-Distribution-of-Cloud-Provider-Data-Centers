The Stacked Column 100 chart is an effective tool for visually displaying the distribution and proportion of given data. In this graph, columns are piled on top of each other, with the cumulative portion of each stacked element consistently adding up to a total of 100%. This is similar to the StackedColumnSeries, with the key difference being that in the StackedColumn100Series, the cumulative total of stacked elements always equals 100%.

<b>SegmentSpacing : </b>

The [SegmentSpacing](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/winui/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Charts.StackedColumnSeries.html#Syncfusion_UI_Xaml_Charts_StackedColumnSeries_SegmentSpacingProperty) property is utilized to customize the space between two segments. The default spacing value is 0, and it can vary from 0 to 1. In this context, 1 and 0 represent 100% and 0% of the total available space respectively.

<b>CustomTemplate : </b>

The [CustomTemplate](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/winui/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Charts.StackedColumnSeries.html#Syncfusion_UI_Xaml_Charts_StackedColumnSeries_CustomTemplateProperty) property enables you to obtain the preferred view for the stacked column segment.
